Link Aggregator with reactive capabilities. Built on top of Meteor.js, MongoDB, Bootstrap, moment.js, and jQuery.
Coded by Javier Carretero

## Quick Start

$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jscarretero/ReactiveLinkAggregator.git

In one terminal, under the GIT repository directory: 
$ meteor

And on a second terminal, we will open two firefox (or chrome) windows: 
$ firefox localhost:3000


Then, several (fake) user accounts can be created, and the actions of one client will reflect immediately on the view for other clients.
