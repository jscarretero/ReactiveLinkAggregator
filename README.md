Coded by Javier Carretero

## Quick Start

First, start by installing the Meteor framework and by cloning the repository.

	curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
	git clone https://github.com/jscarretero/ReactiveLinkAggregator.git

In one terminal, under the GIT repository directory: 

	meteor

And on a second terminal, open two firefox (or chrome) windows: 

	firefox localhost:3000
	firefox localhost:3000	


Then, several (fake) user accounts can be created, and the actions of one client will reflect immediately in the view of other clients.
